# Object Classification with Webcam using Keras

This project demonstrates real-time object classification on webcam video frames using a pre-trained Keras model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.6.0
- Keras 2.6.0
- OpenCV 4.5.3.56

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd object-classification-with-webcam

3. Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

1. Ensure your webcam or capture device is connected to your computer.

2. Run the program:


3. The program will start capturing video frames from the webcam and perform real-time object classification. The predicted class labels and confidence scores will be printed on the console.

4. Press the ESC key to exit the program.

## Customization

- If you have your own pre-trained Keras model, replace `keras_Model.h5` with your model file in the code (`main.py`).

- Modify the code to customize the input shape, model architecture, or any other aspects as per your requirements.
