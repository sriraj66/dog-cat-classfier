Sure! Here's a high-level algorithm for performing object classification on webcam video frames using the provided code:

1. Load the pre-trained Keras model and the corresponding label file.
2. Initialize the webcam or capture device to start capturing video frames.
3. Enter a loop to continuously capture and process video frames:
   a. Capture a frame from the webcam.
   b. Resize the frame to the required input shape for the model (224x224 pixels).
   c. Normalize the pixel values of the resized frame.
   d. Predict the class label and confidence score for the frame using the pre-trained model.
   e. Display the frame with any overlays or visual indications of the predicted class and confidence score.
   f. Print the predicted class label and confidence score on the console.
   g. Listen for keyboard input to check if the user wants to exit the loop (e.g., pressing the ESC key).
4. Once the loop is exited, release the webcam or capture device and close any open windows.
5. End the program.

Please note that the provided algorithm is a high-level representation, and you may need to modify and expand upon it based on your specific requirements or desired functionality.
